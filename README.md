## 🧩 Who I Am

I'm not just learning to code — I’m learning how to use AI to build meaningful systems.  
With a background in systems thinking, psychology, and communication, I bring a unique lens to AI:

- I think in structures, not snippets
- I care about depth, not just data
- I build for **insight**, not just output

## 🛠 Tech So Far

- Git & GitHub
- Prompt Engineering
- Python (beginner)
- LangChain (exploring)
- OpenAI API (soon)

## 💡 Why Generative AI?

Because it’s **not just tech** — it's the future of how humans think, create, and solve.  
I’m here to learn, contribute, and grow into a role where I can use AI **as a vehicle for transformation** — personal, social, and systemic.
